# CityInfoAPI

## Simple RESTful API that provides information about cities. It is designed to be easy to use with a simple JSON-based interface that returns data in a standardized format.

## To use CityInfoAPI, simply send a GET request to the API endpoint with the name of the city you're interested in. For example:
```
GET /city/dhaka
```
## This will return information about Dhaka, including its latitude, longitude, population, and more.
